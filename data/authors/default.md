Hello World! My name is **Ondiek Elijah Ochieng** aka **“Dev Elie”**
I’m a **Software Engineer**, **a technical article writer** and a **community die-hard**.

I have three years of experience writing **Python** and **JavaScript** code, and I've created notable personal projects and excellent client websites. I work as a contract technical writer, and my responsibilities include developing tutorial applications, writing tests, integrating with CircleCI and other CI/CD platforms, and documenting.

As a big supporter of community service, I'm proud of my recent accomplishment as a speaker at the **Safaricom Engineering Summit**. This experience has helped me redefine my public speaking skills, and I'm looking forward to my next talk. I also recently spoke on "Effective Testing with Python" at the **3rd Annual Pycon Conference**, which I do most of the time. I'm also a FreeCodeCamp, [She Code Africa, Nairobi](https://scanairobi.hashnode.dev/) and [Lux Tech Academy](https://twitter.com/lux_academy) contributor and an active **Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador**.

During my three years of professional development, I've been able to gain professional and practical knowledge of the following programming languages and tools.

**Languages:** `HTML5, CSS3, Python, JavaScript (ES6), SQL`

**Frameworks:** `Flask, FastAPI, React, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap5`

**Tools and Others**: `Git, GitHub, Docker, AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, Sanity.io, GraphCMS, Netlify, CircleCI, Harness CI, MySQL,MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, Linux, Rest APIs, DevOps & Full-Stack development`.

I'm actively looking for a new position as a Software Engineer and would appreciate being notified of any new openings.
