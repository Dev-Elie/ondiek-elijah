Hello World! My name is **Ondiek Elijah Ochieng** aka **“Dev Elie”**
I’m a **Software Engineer**, **a technical article writer** and a **community die-hard**.

I have 3+ years of experience writing **Python** and **JavaScript** code, creating notable personal projects, doing excellent work for my clients, and experience working in a busy tech setting. I work as a contract technical writer, and my responsibilities include developing tutorial applications, writing tests, integrating with CircleCI and other CI/CD platforms, and documenting.

As a big supporter of community service, I'm proud of my recent accomplishment as a speaker at the Safaricom Engineering Summit. This experience has heightened my public speaking strengths and looking forward to more. I also spoke on "Effective Testing with Python" at the 3rd Annual Pycon Conference, among other topics.

I'm a FreeCodeCamp, SheCodeAfrica, Nairobi, and Lux Tech Academy contributor and an active Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, GDSC Lead, and AWS Community Builder.

During my years of professional development, I've been able to gain professional and practical knowledge of the following programming languages and tools.

**Languages:** `HTML5, CSS3, Python, JavaScript (ES6), SQL`

**Frameworks:** `Flask, FastAPI, React, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap5`

**Tools and Others**: `Git, GitHub, Docker, AWS, Azure, Heroku, Digital Ocean, Sanity.io, GraphCMS, GraphQL, Netlify, CircleCI, Harness CI, MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, Cypress, Pact, Pytest, Jest, Chai, Mocha, Linux, Rest APIs`.

I'm actively looking for a new position as a Software Engineer and would appreciate being notified of any new openings, referrals, or recommendations.
